#Epic and User Stories

## Epic

**An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories.**


### Benefits and Use Cases

- Allow to keep track of large, loosely defined ideas in your backlog without the need to overpopulate backlog with multiple items
- Can remember vague idea with one backlog item until your team identifies need to deliver outcome that epic enables
- At that point team can split epic into smaller user stories during backlog refinement
- Epic represents the original idea often closely related to a particular outcome
- User stories associated with that epic represent various aspects of solution you need to deliver, or options you have for satisfying that need

**The concept of epics is useful when following a framework such as Scrum that has explicit timeboxed iterations (sprints). Since work is usually organised into 2-4 week sprints, a placeholder that represents work that cannot be finished within that time frame is useful.**

### Common Pitfalls

- Teams can overcompicate their use of epics by viewing them as more than just large user stories.
- A team creates complex mechanisms to differentiate between epics and user stories, wasting time and effort, when the epic could be simply intended as a placeholder that will be more properly defined when needed.
- Teams can also try to estimate timelines for epics when they are deliberately vague in nature, this can lead to a lot of uncertainty down the line.


## User Story

**A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user/customer who desires the new capability. In consultation with the product owner, a team may divide up work to be done into functional increments of user stories."**

Once a user story is implemented, it is expected to yield some contribution to the value of the overall product, regardless of implementation order. They can often be written on index cards/sticky notes and arranged physically to encourage discussion.

### Benefits and Use Cases

- Minimises risks of delayed feedback if the increments are small
- The product owner has the option to change their mind on schedule priority, allowing for more flexibility.
- Developers have clear and precise acceptance criteria to work with
- Promotes a clear separation between defining "what" (product owner) and "how" (development team)
