#Epic and User Stories

## Epic

**An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories.**


### Benefits and Use cases

- Allow to keep track of large, loosely defined ideas in your backlog without the need to overpopulate backlog with multiple items
- Can remember vague idea with one backlog item until your team identifies need to deliver outcome that epic enables
- At that point team can split epic into smaller user stories during backlog refinement
- Epic represents the original idea often closely related to a particular outcome
